<div class="noindent">In 2005, at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in northern Italy, teachers and students needed an easy way to use electronics and programming to quickly prototype design ideas. As musicians, artists, and designers, they needed a platform that didn’t require engineering expertise. A group of teachers and students, including Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis, built a platform that combined different open technologies. They called it Arduino. The platform integrated software, hardware, microcontrollers, and electronics. All aspects of the platform were openly licensed: hardware designs and documentation with the Attribution-Share-Alike license (CC BY-SA), and software with the GNU General Public License.</div>
<div>Arduino boards are able to read inputs—light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message—and turn it into outputs—activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You send a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board by using the Arduino programming language and Arduino software (based on a piece of open-source software called Processing, a programming tool used to make visual art).</div>
<div>“The reasons for making Arduino open source are complicated,” Tom says. Partly it was about supporting flexibility. The open-source nature of Arduino empowers users to modify it and create a lot of different variations, adding on top of what the founders build. David says this “ended up strengthening the platform far beyond what we had even thought of building.”</div>
<div>For Tom another factor was the impending closure of the Ivrea design school. He’d seen other organizations close their doors and all their work and research just disappear. Open-sourcing ensured that Arduino would outlive the Ivrea closure. Persistence is one thing Tom really likes about open source. If key people leave, or a company shuts down, an open-source product lives on. In Tom’s view, “Open sourcing makes it easier to trust a product.”</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">With the school closing, David and some of the other Arduino founders started a consulting firm and multidisciplinary design studio they called Tinker, in London. Tinker designed products and services that bridged the digital and the physical, and they taught people how to use new technologies in creative ways. Revenue from Tinker was invested in sustaining and enhancing Arduino.</div>
<div>For Tom, part of Arduino’s success is because the founders made themselves the first customer of their product. They made products they themselves personally wanted. It was a matter of “I need this thing,” not “If we make this, we’ll make a lot of money.” Tom notes that being your own first customer makes you more confident and convincing at selling your product.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Arduino’s business model has evolved over time—and Tom says model is a grandiose term for it. Originally, they just wanted to make a few boards and get them out into the world. They started out with two hundred boards, sold them, and made a little profit. They used that to make another thousand, which generated enough revenue to make five thousand. In the early days, they simply tried to generate enough funding to keep the venture going day to day. When they hit the ten thousand mark, they started to think about Arduino as a company. By then it was clear you can open-source the design but still manufacture the physical product. As long as it’s a quality product and sold at a reasonable price, people will buy it.</div>
<div>Arduino now has a worldwide community of makers—students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals. Arduino provides a wiki called Playground (a wiki is where all users can edit and add pages, contributing to and benefiting from collective research). People share code, circuit diagrams, tutorials, DIY instructions, and tips and tricks, and show off their projects. In addition, there’s a multilanguage discussion forum where users can get help using Arduino, discuss topics like robotics, and make suggestions for new Arduino product designs. As of January 2017, 324,928 members had made 2,989,489 posts on 379,044 topics. The worldwide community of makers has contributed an incredible amount of accessible knowledge helpful to novices and experts alike.</div>
<div>Transitioning Arduino from a project to a company was a big step. Other businesses who made boards were charging a lot of money for them. Arduino wanted to make theirs available at a low price to people across a wide range of industries. As with any business, pricing was key. They wanted prices that would get lots of customers but were also high enough to sustain the business.</div>
<div>For a business, getting to the end of the year and not being in the red is a success. Arduino may have an open-licensing strategy, but they are still a business, and all the things needed to successfully run one still apply. David says, “If you do those other things well, sharing things in an open-source way can only help you.”</div>
<div>While openly licensing the designs, documentation, and software ensures longevity, it does have risks. There’s a possibility that others will create knockoffs, clones, and copies. The CC BY-SA license means anyone can produce copies of their boards, redesign them, and even sell boards that copy the design. They don’t have to pay a license fee to Arduino or even ask permission. However, if they republish the design of the board, they have to give attribution to Arduino. If they change the design, they must release the new design using the same Creative Commons license to ensure that the new version is equally free and open.</div>
<div>Tom and David say that a lot of people have built companies off of Arduino, with dozens of Arduino derivatives out there. But in contrast to closed business models that can wring money out of the system over many years because there is no competition, Arduino founders saw competition as keeping them honest, and aimed for an environment of collaboration. A benefit of open over closed is the many new ideas and designs others have contributed back to the Arduino ecosystem, ideas and designs that Arduino and the Arduino community use and incorporate into new products.</div>
<div>Over time, the range of Arduino products has diversified, changing and adapting to new needs and challenges. In addition to simple entry level boards, new products have been added ranging from enhanced boards that provide advanced functionality and faster performance, to boards for creating Internet of Things applications, wearables, and 3-D printing. The full range of official Arduino products includes boards, modules (a smaller form-factor of classic boards), shields (elements that can be plugged onto a board to give it extra features), and kits.<sup><a href="#ref_1" id="cite_1">1</a></sup></div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Arduino’s focus is on high-quality boards, well-designed support materials, and the building of community; this focus is one of the keys to their success. And being open lets you build a real community. David says Arduino’s community is a big strength and something that really does matter—in his words, “It’s good business.” When they started, the Arduino team had almost entirely no idea how to build a community. They started by conducting numerous workshops, working directly with people using the platform to make sure the hardware and software worked the way it was meant to work and solved people’s problems. The community grew organically from there.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">A key decision for Arduino was trademarking the name. The founders needed a way to guarantee to people that they were buying a quality product from a company committed to open-source values and knowledge sharing. Trademarking the Arduino name and logo expresses that guarantee and helps customers easily identify their products, and the products sanctioned by them. If others want to sell boards using the Arduino name and logo, they have to pay a small fee to Arduino. This allows Arduino to scale up manufacturing and distribution while at the same time ensuring the Arduino brand isn’t hurt by low-quality copies.</div>
<div>Current official manufacturers are Smart Projects in Italy, SparkFun in the United States, and Dog Hunter in Taiwan/China. These are the only manufacturers that are allowed to use the Arduino logo on their boards. Trademarking their brand provided the founders with a way to protect Arduino, build it out further, and fund software and tutorial development. The trademark-licensing fee for the brand became Arduino’s revenue-generating model.</div>
<div>How far to open things up wasn’t always something the founders perfectly agreed on. David, who was always one to advocate for opening things up more, had some fears about protecting the Arduino name, thinking people would be mad if they policed their brand. There was some early backlash with a project called Freeduino, but overall, trademarking and branding has been a critical tool for Arduino.</div>
<div>David encourages people and businesses to start by sharing everything as a default strategy, and then think about whether there is anything that really needs to be protected and why. There are lots of good reasons to not open up certain elements. This strategy of sharing everything is certainly the complete opposite of how today’s world operates, where nothing is shared. Tom suggests a business formalize which elements are based on open sharing and which are closed. An Arduino blog post from 2013 entitled “Send In the Clones,” by one of the founders Massimo Banzi, does a great job of explaining the full complexities of how trademarking their brand has played out, distinguishing between official boards and those that are clones, derivatives, compatibles, and counterfeits.<sup><a href="#ref_2" id="cite_2">2</a></sup></div>
<div>For David, an exciting aspect of Arduino is the way lots of people can use it to adapt technology in many different ways. Technology is always making more things possible but doesn’t always focus on making it easy to use and adapt. This is where Arduino steps in. Arduino’s goal is “making things that help other people make things.”</div>
<div>Arduino has been hugely successful in making technology and electronics reach a larger audience. For Tom, Arduino has been about “the democratization of technology.” Tom sees Arduino’s open-source strategy as helping the world get over the idea that technology has to be protected. Tom says, “Technology is a literacy everyone should learn.”</div>
<div>Ultimately, for Arduino, going open has been good business—good for product development, good for distribution, good for pricing, and good for manufacturing.</div>
