<div class="noindent">Cofounded by open education visionary Dr. David Wiley and education-technology strategist Kim Thanos, Lumen Learning is dedicated to improving student success, bringing new ideas to pedagogy, and making education more affordable by facilitating adoption of open educational resources. In 2012, David and Kim partnered on a grant-funded project called the Kaleidoscope Open Course Initiative.<sup><a href="#ref_1" id="cite_1">1</a></sup> It involved a set of fully open general-education courses across eight colleges predominantly serving at-risk students, with goals to dramatically reduce textbook costs and collaborate to improve the courses to help students succeed. David and Kim exceeded those goals: the cost of the required textbooks, replaced with OER, decreased to zero dollars, and average student-success rates improved by 5 to 10 percent when compared with previous years. After a second round of funding, a total of more than twenty-five institutions participated in and benefited from this project. It was career changing for David and Kim to see the impact this initiative had on low-income students. David and Kim sought further funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who asked them to define a plan to scale their work in a financially sustainable way. That is when they decided to create Lumen Learning.</div>
<div>David and Kim went back and forth on whether it should be a nonprofit or for-</div>
<div>profit. A nonprofit would make it a more comfortable fit with the education sector but meant they’d be constantly fund-raising and seeking grants from philanthropies. Also, grants usually require money to be used in certain ways for specific deliverables. If you learn things along the way that change how you think the grant money should be used, there often isn’t a lot of flexibility to do so.</div>
<div>But as a for-profit, they’d have to convince educational institutions to pay for what Lumen had to offer. On the positive side, they’d have more control over what to do with the revenue and investment money; they could make decisions to invest the funds or use them differently based on the situation and shifting opportunities. In the end, they chose the for-profit status, with its different model for and approach to sustainability.</div>
<div>Right from the start, David and Kim positioned Lumen Learning as a way to help institutions engage in open educational resources, or OER. OER are teaching, learning, and research materials, in all different media, that reside in the public domain or are released under an open license that permits free use and repurposing by others.&#160;</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Originally, Lumen did custom contracts for each institution. This was complicated and challenging to manage. However, through that process patterns emerged which allowed them to generalize a set of approaches and offerings. Today they don’t customize as much as they used to, and instead they tend to work with customers who can use their off-the-shelf options. Lumen finds that institutions and faculty are generally very good at seeing the value Lumen brings and are willing to pay for it. Serving disadvantaged learner populations has led Lumen to be very pragmatic; they describe what they offer in quantitative terms—with facts and figures—and in a way that is very student-focused. Lumen Learning helps colleges and universities—</div>

</ul>
</div>



<div><br/></div>
<div class="noindent">Lumen has developed a suite of open, Creative Commons–licensed courseware in more than sixty-five subjects. All courses are freely and publicly available right off their website. They can be copied and used by others as long as they provide attribution to Lumen Learning following the terms of the Creative Commons license.</div>
<div>Then there are three types of bundled services that cost money. One option, which Lumen calls Candela courseware, offers integration with the institution’s learning-management system, technical and pedagogical support, and tracking of effectiveness. Candela courseware costs institutions ten dollars per enrolled student.</div>
<div>A second option is Waymaker, which offers the services of Candela but adds personalized learning technologies, such as study plans, automated messages, and assessments, and helps instructors find and support the students who need it most. Waymaker courses cost twenty-five dollars per enrolled student.</div>
<div>The third and emerging line of business for Lumen is providing guidance and support for institutions and state systems that are pursuing the development of complete OER degrees. Often called Z-Degrees, these programs eliminate textbook costs for students in all courses that make up the degree (both required and elective) by replacing commercial textbooks and other expensive resources with OER.&#160;</div>
<div>Lumen generates revenue by charging for their value-added tools and services on top of their free courses, just as solar-power companies provide the tools and services that help people use a free resource—sunlight. And Lumen’s business model focuses on getting the institutions to pay, not the students. With projects they did prior to Lumen, David and Kim learned that students who have access to all course materials from day one have greater success. If students had to pay, Lumen would have to restrict access to those who paid. Right from the start, their stance was that they would not put their content behind a paywall. Lumen invests zero dollars in technologies and processes for restricting access—no digital rights management, no time bombs. While this has been a challenge from a business-model perspective, from an open-access perspective, it has generated immense goodwill in the community.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">In most cases, development of their courses is funded by the institution Lumen has a contract with. When creating new courses, Lumen typically works with the faculty who are teaching the new course. They’re often part of the institution paying Lumen, but sometimes Lumen has to expand the team and contract faculty from other institutions. First, the faculty identifies all of the course’s learning outcomes. Lumen then searches for, aggregates, and curates the best OER they can find that addresses those learning needs, which the faculty reviews.</div>
<div>Sometimes faculty like the existing OER but not the way it is presented. The open licensing of existing OER allows Lumen to pick and choose from images, videos, and other media to adapt and customize the course. Lumen creates new content as they discover gaps in existing OER. Test-bank items and feedback for students on their progress are areas where new content is frequently needed. Once a course is created, Lumen puts it on their platform with all the attributions and links to the original sources intact, and any of Lumen’s new content is given an Attribution (CC BY) license.</div>
<div>Using only OER made them experience firsthand how complex it could be to mix differently licensed work together. A common strategy with OER is to place the Creative Commons license and attribution information in the website’s footer, which stays the same for all pages. This doesn’t quite work, however, when mixing different OER together.</div>
<div>Remixing OER often results in multiple attributions on every page of every course—text from one place, images from another, and videos from yet another. Some are licensed as Attribution (CC BY), others as Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA). If this information is put within the text of the course, faculty members sometimes try to edit it and students find it a distraction. Lumen dealt with this challenge by capturing the license and attribution information as metadata, and getting it to show up at the end of each page.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Lumen’s commitment to open licensing and helping low-income students has led to strong relationships with institutions, open-education enthusiasts, and grant funders. People in their network generously increase the visibility of Lumen through presentations, word of mouth, and referrals. Sometimes the number of general inquiries exceed Lumen’s sales capacity.</div>
<div>To manage demand and ensure the success of projects, their strategy is to be proactive and focus on what’s going on in higher education in different regions of the United States, watching out for things happening at the system level in a way that fits with what Lumen offers. A great example is the Virginia community college system, which is building out Z-Degrees. David and Kim say there are nine other U.S. states with similar system-level activity where Lumen is strategically focusing its efforts. Where there are projects that would require a lot of resources on Lumen’s part, they prioritize the ones that would impact the largest number of students.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">As a business, Lumen is committed to openness. There are two core nonnegotiables: Lumen’s use of CC BY, the most permissive of the Creative Commons licenses, for all the materials it creates; and day-one access for students. Having clear nonnegotiables allows them to then engage with the education community to solve for other challenges and work with institutions to identify new business models that achieve institution goals, while keeping Lumen healthy.</div>
<div>Openness also means that Lumen’s OER must necessarily be nonexclusive and nonrivalrous. This represents several big challenges for the business model: Why should you invest in creating something that people will be reluctant to pay for? How do you ensure that the investment the diverse education community makes in OER is not exploited? Lumen thinks we all need to be clear about how we are benefiting from and contributing to the open&#160;</div>
<div>community.</div>
<div>In the OER sector, there are examples of corporations, and even institutions, acting as free riders. Some simply take and use open resources without paying anything or contributing anything back. Others give back the minimum amount so they can save face. Sustainability will require those using open resources to give back an amount that seems fair or even give back something that is generous.&#160;</div>
<div>Lumen does track institutions accessing and using their free content. They proactively contact those institutions, with an estimate of how much their students are saving and encouraging them to switch to a paid model. Lumen explains the advantages of the paid model: a more interactive relationship with Lumen; integration with the institution’s learning-management system; a guarantee of support for faculty and students; and future sustainability with funding supporting the evolution and improvement of the OER they are using.</div>
<div>Lumen works hard to be a good corporate citizen in the OER community. For David and Kim, a good corporate citizen gives more than they take, adds unique value, and is very transparent about what they are taking from community, what they are giving back, and what they are monetizing. Lumen believes these are the building blocks of a sustainable model and strives for a correct balance of all these factors.</div>
<div>Licensing all the content they produce with CC BY is a key part of giving more value than they take. They’ve also worked hard at finding the right structure for their value-add and how to package it in a way that is understandable and repeatable.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">As of the fall 2016 term, Lumen had eighty-six different open courses, working relationships with ninety-two institutions, and more than seventy-five thousand student enrollments. Lumen received early start-up funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Shuttleworth Foundation. Since then, Lumen has also attracted investment funding. Over the last three years, Lumen has been roughly 60 percent grant funded, 20 percent revenue earned, and 20 percent funded with angel capital. Going forward, their strategy is to replace grant funding with revenue.</div>
<div>In creating Lumen Learning, David and Kim say they’ve landed on solutions they never imagined, and there is still a lot of learning taking place. For them, open business models are an emerging field where we are all learning through sharing. Their biggest recommendations for others wanting to pursue the open model are to make your commitment to open resources public, let people know where you stand, and don’t back away from it. It really is about trust.</div>
